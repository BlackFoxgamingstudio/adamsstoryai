   - Add support for more advanced image generation models
   - Implement more sophisticated character composition

2. **Enhance Character Development**
   - Implement the full 20-layer character transformation pipeline
   - Create comprehensive character reports
   - Improve feedback processing for characters

3. **Add Authentication**
   - Implement user registration and login
   - Add project ownership and sharing
   - Implement access control

4. **Improve Film School Features**
   - Enhance question generation with more film theory
   - Improve feedback quality and specificity
   - Add more detailed scene and character analysis

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement proper caching
   - Add background job processing
   - Optimize image generation and storage

## Known Issues

- Placeholder vector database needs to be replaced with a proper solution
- Image generation can fail with certain prompts
- UI needs more polish and responsiveness improvements
- No error handling for API rate limits
- No persistence for the feedback history

## Conclusion

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for the AI-Powered Storyboard App with the core functionality working as described in the implementation guide. Further development is needed to fully implement all the advanced features outlined in the guide, but the current version is functional and demonstrates the key concepts.
